Today marks my 36th orbit around the sun.  
Unlike most birthdays, this one feels like a checkpoint — not for age, but for trajectory.  
After years of building, breaking, and evolving, I felt it was time to pause and document the orbit I’ve carved through the tech universe.

## 🪐 Early Orbits: Gravity Wells and Curiosity

I began my career caught in low orbit — support roles, repetitive tasks, underestimated potential.  
Still, something pulled me toward the unknown: curiosity.  
I didn’t have the map, but I had the will to break free from gravity.

## 🚀 Propulsion: Breaking the Atmosphere

This past year, I started building tools to automate my workflow and strengthen my Linux and security skills.  
From custom Bash scripts and OpenSSL trainers to interactive CLI utilities — I began solving real problems in my own environment.

I explored certificate generation, system compromise detection, Linux hardening, and password management — not just through theory, but by building hands-on tools and experiments.

It wasn’t just about writing code — it was about writing **confidence**.

## 🌌 Trajectory: Toward Hyperscale

Now, I’m setting my course toward:  
- 🔐 advanced infrastructure security  
- 🌐 scalable networking  
- 🏢 hyperscale datacenter architecture  
- 🤖 AI-powered automation  

My goal is to build systems that are not just powerful — but also elegant, secure, and future-proof.

## 🧭 The True North

After 36 revolutions around the sun, I’ve realized that growth doesn’t always mean changing direction.  
Sometimes, it’s about holding your course — with more speed, more clarity, and more intent.

I’ve never let anyone underestimate me or reduce my capabilities to a title, a role, or a résumé.  
⚡ The orbit is mine — and I choose where it goes next.

If you're on a similar orbit — learning, building, sometimes doubting, but always moving —  
then happy birthday to you too, in spirit. 🎉
